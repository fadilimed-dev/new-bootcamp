## Logo Placeholder

Place your logo image file here as `logo-placeholder.png`.

The logo should be:
- Recommended size: 200px width (height will scale proportionally)
- Format: PNG, JPG, or SVG
- File name: `logo-placeholder.png`

If you don't have a logo yet, you can:
1. Use any placeholder image generator online
2. Create a simple logo using design tools
3. Use the provided `logo-placeholder.svg` file (you'll need to update the views to use .svg instead of .png)

The logo will appear at the top of every page in the header.
